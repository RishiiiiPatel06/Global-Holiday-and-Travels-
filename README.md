# Global Holiday & Travels

A travel and holiday planning web application that enables users to explore worldwide public holidays, discover destinations, and build itineraries that can be exported and shared. The project aims to merge public-holiday data with practical travel planning rather than functioning as another static tourism platform.

- Search public holidays by country and year.
- Discover travel destinations linked to specific holiday periods.

Final Note

Development progress should start immediately. Begin by pushing the basic project skeleton (frontend + backend folders) and add at least one functioning API route with mock data before expanding features.

Done.  
If you want, I can now:
- generate the full project starter template (React + Express with folders)
- build a UI wireframe layout
- auto-generate API documentation Swagger

Tell me which one you want next.
